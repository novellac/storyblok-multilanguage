# MIXINS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains js from storyblok. According to their documentation,

Storyblok’s Javascript bridge needs to be registered in the mounted hook of every page component to enable the “True Live Preview” feature. To avoid duplicating the code on every we create the following Vuejs mixin in a new folder mixins/storyblokLivePreview.js.
